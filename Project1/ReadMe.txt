#1.1 Makefile, pipe, and redirect
Files that submitted are: cal.c, quadratic.c, square.c, cal.in, makefile, exec.sh
Execution Instruction:  {cslinux1:~/<your-directory>}bash exec.sh
It will do the following:
1. compile given c programs
2. link is given c program
3. execute the cal.exe 
4. pass the cal.in as input
5. print the output to given f arg
6. execute and append the wc output through the pipe in given f
for confirm the result: after execution do the following: {cslinux1:~/<your-directory>}more <f>

#1.2
#traverse.sh
Files that submitted are: traverse.sh
Execution Instruction: {cslinux1:~/<your-directory>}bash traverse.sh <d> <l> 
It will do the following:
1. get the arg and assign it to the variable
2. use the find command to traverse recursively through a given directory and subdirectory
3. print files and directory
4. redirect the stdout to given arg
#traverse-loop.sh 
I provided two methods for traversing the direcotries and files: the second one use for loop but it would difficult to go thorugh all subdirectories with loop

for confirm the result: after execution do the following: {cslinux1:~/<your-directory>}more <l>

#1.3
All provided script has been tested successfully in cslinux1.utdallas.edu Linux server
#log & myfile attached for prove of execution.

#Thank you for your time
