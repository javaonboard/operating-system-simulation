sample OS written in C

If you are reading this, It means you are doomed to learn Operating system in C language. 
This is not a prefect code that going to work without issue, but at least give you some ideas.

It has severasl sections according to given assignments and each section has a ReadMe.

Don't use the same just use as a sample.

Thanks
